# Latest Research Findings in Animal Motion Tracking and Multi-Subject Pose Estimation (2025)

This document summarizes the most recent developments and research findings related to animal motion tracking, multi-subject pose estimation, and mobile implementation approaches. These findings will inform our future research directions.

## Latest Developments in Multi-Animal Pose Estimation

### DeepLabCut Advancements

DeepLabCut remains one of the leading frameworks for animal pose estimation, with several important developments:

- The original paper "DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning" surpassed 3,000 Google Scholar citations in January 2024, demonstrating its continued relevance and impact in the field.
- Recent updates to DeepLabCut have focused on improving multi-animal tracking capabilities, particularly for scenarios with occlusions and animal interactions.
- The framework has expanded to support a wider range of animal species beyond the initial focus on laboratory mice.

### SuperAnimal Models

A significant advancement published in Nature Communications is the development of "SuperAnimal" pretrained pose estimation models:

- These models provide unified pose estimation across 45+ species without requiring manual labeling.
- The approach demonstrates remarkable data efficiency, addressing a critical need in behavioral quantification studies.
- The models show strong generalization capabilities across different animal types, which could be leveraged for our cat and dog tracking needs.

### SLEAP Framework

SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses) has emerged as a versatile deep learning-based multi-animal pose-tracking tool:

- Designed specifically for videos of diverse animals, including during social behavior
- Published in Nature Methods, the framework handles challenging scenarios like animal interactions
- Provides a modern alternative to DeepLabCut with specific optimizations for social behaviors

### APT-36K Dataset

The APT-36K dataset has become a benchmark for animal pose estimation, enabling:

- Supervised animal pose estimation on a single frame under intra- and inter-domain transfer learning settings
- Inter-species domain generalization testing for unseen animals
- Animal pose tracking across different species and domains

## Custom TensorFlow Lite Models for Animal Pose Detection

### YOLOv8 Pose Models for Animals

Recent developments have demonstrated the effectiveness of fine-tuning YOLOv8 Pose models for animal pose estimation:

- YOLOv8 provides a balance of accuracy and speed suitable for mobile deployment
- Fine-tuning approaches have been documented for adapting human pose models to animal subjects
- The models can be converted to TensorFlow Lite format for efficient mobile deployment

### MoveNet Adaptations

Google's MoveNet, originally designed for human pose estimation, has shown promising results when adapted for animal subjects:

- The lightning variant offers real-time performance suitable for mobile applications
- Recent applications have demonstrated its adaptability to non-human subjects through transfer learning
- Integration examples with React Native have been published, providing valuable implementation guidance

### BlazePose Alternative

BlazePose, developed by Google, has emerged as a strong alternative for real-time pose estimation on mobile devices:

- Offers better performance on mobile devices compared to some other models
- Can be adapted for animal pose estimation through transfer learning
- Provides 33 keypoints that can be mapped to animal anatomical structures

## Mobile Implementation Approaches

### MobilePoser System

A notable advancement from Northwestern University engineers is the MobilePoser system:

- Performs full-body motion capture using sensors already embedded in consumer mobile devices
- Eliminates the need for specialized rooms, expensive equipment, or bulky cameras
- Demonstrates the feasibility of sophisticated motion tracking on standard smartphone hardware

### React Native VisionCamera Integration

Significant progress has been made in integrating TensorFlow Lite models with React Native using the VisionCamera library:

- Marc Rousavy's work on VisionCamera V3 integration with TFLite and Skia provides a blueprint for high-performance pose detection
- The `react-native-fast-tflite` library enables shared ArrayBuffers without copying, optimizing performance
- Recent examples demonstrate real-time pose detection using MoveNet.SinglePose.Lightning model

### Performance Optimization Techniques

New approaches for optimizing model performance on mobile devices have emerged:

- GPU delegation for TensorFlow Lite models directly from JavaScript
- Frame processor plugins for real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite Task Vision
- Optimized camera processing pipelines that reduce latency and power consumption

## Future Research Directions Based on Latest Findings

Based on these findings, we should adjust our research directions to incorporate:

1. **Transfer Learning from SuperAnimal Models**: Investigate leveraging the pre-trained SuperAnimal models as a starting point for our cat and dog pose estimation.

2. **Evaluation of YOLOv8 vs. MoveNet vs. BlazePose**: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these three approaches for animal pose estimation, focusing on accuracy, speed, and mobile resource utilization.

3. **React Native VisionCamera Integration**: Prioritize integration with the latest VisionCamera framework and react-native-fast-tflite for optimal performance.

4. **SLEAP-Inspired Social Interaction Analysis**: Adopt methodologies from SLEAP for analyzing interactions between animals, which aligns with our goal of tracking multiple subjects simultaneously.

5. **APT-36K Dataset Utilization**: Leverage the APT-36K dataset for training and validation of our animal pose estimation models.
