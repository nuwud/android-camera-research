# Android Camera Research

A comprehensive research repository on Android camera development, with a focus on skeletal tracking and augmented reality using clean architecture patterns to avoid common Gradle and native code conflicts.

## Overview

This project explores various approaches for building Android camera applications that incorporate skeletal tracking and AR capabilities. By following clean architecture patterns, we aim to minimize the common issues that arise when integrating Camera2 API, ML Kit, ARCore, and other libraries that tend to conflict with each other.

## Key Findings

### Integration Challenges

1. **Camera Access Conflicts**: Camera2 API, ARCore, and Vuforia often compete for camera access, requiring careful resource management and camera sharing configurations.

2. **Dependency Versioning**: ML Kit, ARCore, Vuforia, and camera libraries frequently have conflicting dependency requirements, necessitating centralized dependency management.

3. **Native Code Issues**: NDK and ABI configurations are critical when combining libraries with native components.

4. **Threading Complexity**: Frame processing, ML inference, and AR rendering each require proper threading strategies to maintain performance.

5. **npm/Node.js Build Issues**: React Native camera integrations face unique challenges with npm scripts, patch-package, buffer handling, and module compilation.

6. **Multi-Subject Attribution**: Maintaining correct subject-skeleton associations during interactions between multiple subjects poses significant challenges.

### Recommended Approach

Based on our research, the most effective approach for integrating these technologies involves:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns through well-defined modules
2. **Centralized Dependency Management**: Using Gradle Kotlin DSL and version catalogs
3. **Explicit Thread Management**: Dedicated threads for camera, processing, and rendering
4. **Shared Camera Configuration**: Proper configuration of Camera2 API for shared use with ARCore or Vuforia
5. **Optimized Frame Processing**: Selective frame processing and resolution reduction for ML Kit
6. **Strategic Camera Provider Selection**: Choosing between Camera2, ARCore, and Vuforia based on specific use cases
7. **Two-Stage Detection**: First detect subjects, then apply appropriate pose detection models
8. **Tracking Algorithms**: Implement IoU-based tracking to maintain subject identity across frames
